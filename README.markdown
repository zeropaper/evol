Evol
====

Description
===========

The Evol Drupal theme is a starting point for other themes.


Installation
============

As all normal themes... :) Extract the archive in the directory "themes" directory (sites/all/themes).

Use
===

If you are a Drupal theming rockstar, you would probaly create a theme from NULL and add:

  base theme = evol
  
to the .info file of theme and maybe read the source code.
Reading the code might reveal you features/functions who are undocumented elsewhere.
And it can never be more accruate and up to date! :)
For the other, I'll made soon a skeleton with the minimal requirements.


Nice to have
============

SASS & Compasss

SASS installation requires Ruby and root access (windows users... I don't know how you are calling your root users... sorry).


... More to come ...
